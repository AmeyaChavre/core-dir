Complete the code in Index.js in a way that 
the function should return a single object
 which has key as the parameter someKey and value as someValue

*/

let convertToKeyValuePair = (someKey,someValue)=>{

    // this function should return a single object which has 
    //key as the value of someKey and value as someValue

   

};

module.exports = {convertToKeyValuePair:convertToKeyValuePair};
*******************************************
solution:


let convertToKeyValuePair = (someKey,someValue)=>{

    // this function should return a single object which has 
    //key as the value of someKey and value as someValue

let someObject = 
{
	[someKey]:someValue // enter square braces around the key name to make sure it's value gets printed..!!
}
return (someObject);

}


console.log(convertToKeyValuePair("Hello","Moto"));
